    abstract = {The Texas freeze of February 2021 left more than 4.5 million customers (more than 10 million people) without electricity at its peak, some for several days. The freeze had cascading effects on other services reliant upon electricity including drinking water treatment and medical services. Economic losses from lost output and damage are estimated to be $130 billion in Texas alone. In the wake of the freeze, there has been major fallout among regulators and utilities as actors sought to apportion blame and utilities and generators began to settle up accounts. This piece offers a retrospective on what caused the blackouts and the knock-on effects on other services, the subsequent financial and political effects of the freeze, and the implications for Texas and the country going forward. Texas failed to sufficiently winterize its electricity and gas systems after 2011. Feedback between failures in the two systems made the situation worse. Overall, the state faced outages of 30 GW of electricity as demand reached unprecedented highs. The gap between production and demand forced the non-profit grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), to cut off supply to millions of customers or face a systems collapse that by some accounts was minutes away. The 2021 freeze suggests a need to rethink the states regulatory approach to energy to avoid future such outcomes. Weatherization, demand response, and expanded interstate interconnections are potential solutions Texas should consider to avoid generation losses, reduce demand, and tap neighboring states capacity.}

The paper also looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take in the next decade or so. In particular, it postulates the need for objective comparative EPF studies involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model’s outperformance of another.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel price forecasting method based on wavelet transform combined with ARIMA and GARCH models. By wavelet transform, the historical price series is decomposed and reconstructed into one approximation series and some detail series. Then each subseries can be separately predicted by a suitable time series model. The final forecast is obtained by composing the forecasted results of each subseries. This proposed method is examined on Spanish and PJM electricity markets and compared with some other forecasting methods.}

Seeking for more accurate price forecasting techniques, this paper proposes a new hybrid method based on wavelet transform (WT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict electricity prices. The proposed method is examined by using the data from New South Wales (NSW) of Australian national electricity market. Empirical testing indicates that the proposed method can provide more accurate and effective results than the other price forecasting methods.}

ABSTRACT = {Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error.},

ABSTRACT = {Our research involves analyzing the latest models used for electricity price forecasting, which include both traditional inferential statistical methods and newer deep learning techniques. Through our analysis of historical data and the use of multiple weekday dummies, we have proposed an innovative solution for forecasting electricity spot prices. This solution involves breaking down the spot price series into two components: a seasonal trend component and a stochastic component. By utilizing this approach, we are able to provide highly accurate predictions for all considered time frames.},

ABSTRACT = {In day-ahead electricity price forecasting (EPF) variable selection is a crucial issue. Conducting an empirical study involving state-of-the-art parsimonious expert models as benchmarks, datasets from three major power markets and five classes of automated selection and shrinkage procedures (single-step elimination, stepwise regression, ridge regression, lasso and elastic nets), we show that using the latter two classes can bring significant accuracy gains compared to commonly-used EPF models. In particular, one of the elastic nets, a class that has not been considered in EPF before, stands out as the best performing model overall.},

ABSTRACT = {In a modern and dynamic electricity market, ensuring reliable, sustainable and efficient electricity distribution is a pillar of primary importance for grid operation. The high penetration of renewable energy sources and the formation of competitive prices for utilities play a critical role in the wider economic development. Electricity load and price forecasting have been a key focus of researchers in the last decade due to the substantial economic implications for both producers, aggregators and end consumers. Many forecasting techniques and methods have emerged during this period. This paper conducts a extensive and analytical review of the prevailing load and electricity price forecasting methods in the context of the modern wholesale electricity market. The study is separated into seven main sections. The first section provides the key challenges and the main contributions of this study. The second section delves into the workings of the electricity market, providing a detailed analysis of the three markets that have evolved, their functions and the key factors influencing overall market dynamics. In the third section, the main methodologies of electricity load and price forecasting approaches are analyzed in detail. The fourth section offers a comprehensive review of the existing literature focusing on load forecasting, highlighting various methodologies, models and their applications in this field. This section emphasizes the advances that have been made in all categories of forecasting models and their practical application in different market scenarios. The fifth section focuses on electricity price forecasting studies, summarizing important research papers investigating various modeling approaches. The sixth section constitutes a fundamental discussion and comparison between the load- and price-focused studies that are analyzed. Finally, by examining both traditional and cutting-edge forecasting methods, this review identifies key trends, challenges and future directions in the field. Overall, this paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis leading to the understanding of the state-of-the-art models in load and price forecasting and to be an important resource for researchers and professionals in the energy industry. Based on the research conducted, there is an increasing trend in the use of artificial intelligence models in recent years, due to the flexibility and adaptability they offer for big datasets, compared to traditional models. The combination of models, such as ensemble methods, gives us very promising results.},
